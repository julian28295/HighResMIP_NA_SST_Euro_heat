This repository includes python scripts & Jupyter notebooks for the analysis of models included in the HighResMIP. Model composites of cold North Atlantic SSTs are examined, which are compared to the ERA5 reanalysis product used as reference. The composite analysis is based on the previous study by Kr√ºger et al. (2023). https://a.tellusjournals.se/articles/10.16993/tellusa.3235
